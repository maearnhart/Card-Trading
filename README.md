# About
Card Trading is a programming project for UAA's A311 Data Structures and Algorithms class developed by Micheal Earnhart, Utsav Dutta, and Mackenzie Boyle.

The project focuses on the simulation and optimization of card trading among indivuals, focusing on the graph-like nature of trade maps, to allow users to analyze the held assets of various simulated users and manage trading between them. The project focuses on optimization, allowing users to get optimial trade routes data to acquire cards of their choice. 

The project utilizes C++ data structures of binary trees, maps, and hash maps, to create efficient sorting, indexing, and searching of cards and trades. Of which information is displayed to the user through terminal graphics.
